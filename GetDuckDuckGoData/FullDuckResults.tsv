Privatization would replace the pay-as-you-go Social Security system with a privately-run system in which each taxpayer has a separate account. Those in favor of privatization believe this approach...	Social Security is less of an investment program than an intergenerational transfer of wealth. Those dollars could be put to better use by changing the system to something more investment-focused. A potential benefit of privatization is that it helps boost private savings. It increases the pool of capital that can be invested back into the economy.	According to the AK model's simulations, privatizing social security can generate very major long-run increases in output and living standards. These gains come largely, but not exclusively, at the expense of existing generations. Indeed, the pure efficiency gains from privatization can be substantial.	Privatizing Social Security will put billions of dollars into the pockets of Wall Street financial services corporations in the form of brokerage and management fees. Private Social Security accounts will be a boon to Wall Street, where banks and investment advisors could receive over $100 in fees for each account. [ 53]	According to the AK Model, privatizing social security can create major long-run increases in output and living standards which come largely but not exclusively at the expense of existing generations.	Social Security privatization is a movement to eliminate, or reduce, the United States' Social Security program, in favor of private retirement accounts. This has its roots in the economic prediction that the government plan will be operating at a deficit by about the year 2016.	Privatizing Social Security would allow some of those funds to be directed toward stock equity or mutual funds, creating more potential returns - especially if account holders give permission to take on more risk. 2. It could resolve the issue of cash shortfall expected to it the system.	Private accounts do nothing to address Social Security solvency. In fact, because private accounts are financed by taking money out of Social Security, privatization nearly doubles Social Security's funding gap and moves forward the date of its insolvency. Myth 2: Returns from private accounts will make up for the cuts in Social Security benefits.	Privatization means increased retirement risks, severe cuts in Social Security benefits, and a multi-trillion dollar increase in the federal debt… Right now, Social Security provides a guaranteed income, paying benefits every month for life, with increases for inflation.

snes-03347	"A meme stating that every person who has been diagnosed with cancer has a pH that is ""too acidic"" (and that cancer cannot live in an alkaline environment) has been popping up on social media ..."	People with cancer have a pH that is too acidic. This is unfounded. Dr Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for showing that cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, oxygen-rich environment, but thrives in an acidic, low oxygen environment. This is incorrect, he won for his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme.	"Does ""every single person"" suffering from cancer have ""a pH that is too acidic""? This startling claim is made on a meme circulating on Facebook in South Africa. The meme includes a graphic with an arrow pointing to ""acidic"" labelled ""illnesses"", and an arrow pointing to ""alkaline"" labelled ""health"". It ends with a questionable claim of authority: ""Dr Otto Warburg won ..."	Virtually everyone with cancer has low pH levels. This is because cancer is created, and thrives, in a body that has low pH levels, a body that is acidic. Low pH causes your body to store more toxins in cells, and reduces oxygen levels, both of which are fundamental to the development of cancer. When cancer cells grow, they produce even more acid.	Cancer cells enjoy living in an acidic body and turn the glucose ferments into lactic acid. Terminal cancer patients usually have the lowest pH levels of all, ranging between 4.0 and 5.5. As Keiichi Morishita states, back in 1964, one in 214 people was diagnosed with cancer and today this number is about 1 in 2 males and 1 in 3 females.	Bile from the liver has a pH between 7.5 - 8.8. But when the acidity of the whole body becomes higher, pancreatic juices and bile also become more acidic. Acidic pancreatic juices and bile may become destructive and irritate the surrounding tissues of the pancreas and liver, causing inflammation, stones, ulcers and even cancer. Acidic Bile Reflux	Our acid-base balance is well regulated - blood pH is tightly controlled normally by the body between 7.35 and 7.45. If the pH level becomes too acidic or alkaline, that could be life threatening and is typically an indication of a serious health problem, though it's not the underlying cause.	So the idea is that a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and low in acidic foods will raise the body's pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and prevent or even cure cancer. It should be noted that these are studies of cancer cells in a dish and do not represent the complex nature of how tumors behave in the human body.	"May 25, 2018Probably about 7.8. We cannot survive with a blood pH much different from 7.40. The ""normal"" range is 7.35 to 7.45. Any significant deviation will cause major problems, and is in fact a sign ..."	"The hoax: An acid body is a magnet for sickness, disease, cancer and aging. Eating more alkaline foods helps shift your body's pH and oxygenates your system. Alkaline foods keep your body healthy and functioning correctly, preventing and combating cancer."". The Truth: Our experts say that, in general, the answer is no."

snes-00644	Dear Reader, Although rusty metal has almost become synonymous with tetanus, stepping on a nail isn't necessarily enough to send a person running, or hobbling, to get a tetanus shot. While tetanus is a serious bacterial disease, there are many factors to consider and symptoms to look for when determining whether or not a vaccine is needed.	The old wives' tale is true -- stepping on a rusty nail has the potential to cause tetanus. But so can a perfectly clean nail, a sewing needle or a scratch from an animal. Tetanus is caused by bacteria known as Clostridium tetani, which is commonly found in soil, dust and animal feces.Because of its presence in soil and manure, gardeners and others who work in agriculture are particularly at ...	A rusty nail has been associated to tetanus for a long time. It is then not surprising that stepping on it requires serious concern. A rusty nail can be very dangerous, as it is a perfect environment for the Clostridium tetani —a bacterium causing tetanus—spores to grow.	Rust does not cause tetanus.This notion stems from the oft-repeated claim that stepping on a rusty nail will give you the disease. There are valid scientific reasons, discussed below, for using a ...	When you think of tetanus, does a rusty nail come to mind? Well, that image might be a little rusty, as tetanus has nothing to do with rust itself. Tetanus is a serious infection caused by ...	Rust also creates a new, rough texture on the surface of a nail, full of microscopic hiding places for bacteria. The disease's effects can be severe, even fatal: C. tetani releases a powerful neurotoxin called tetanospasmin that can cause muscle stiffness and convulsive spasms that usually begin in the jaw — thus the infection's nickname ...	Stepping on a rusty nail will induce tetanus, since the rusty nail is usually full of dirt and thus, might contain Clostridium tetanibacteria which can cause tetanus. Immediately after stepping on a rusty nail, you have to do the procedures to avoid infection.	Stepping on nails or other sharp objects is one way people are exposed to the bacteria that cause tetanus. These bacteria are in the environment and get into the body through breaks in the skin. The spores can get into the body through broken skin, usually through injuries from contaminated objects.	Why does stepping on a nail cause tetanus? Rusty nails do not cause tetanus themselves, but they often occupy dirty or dusty areas that harbor Clostridium tetani, the bacteria that cause tetanus . Stepping on a nail can spread this bacteria to humans. Wounds are the most common way people get tetanus.

How a Background Check for Guns Works. If you decide to buy a gun from an FFL, you have to fill out a 4473 Form (also called a Firearms Transaction Record). After you fill out the form, the person selling you a gun will run your information through NICS, which is maintained by the FBI. Running a background check through NICS takes about 30 seconds.	Local gun store: Your local gun store likely has a couple different options to sell your gun. They can either buy it outright and sell it themselves, or you can hire them to sell it for you as they take a portion of the profit. Try to keep in mind that if you sell it to the gun store, they will give you a very low offer that you may be insulted by.

Verdict: False Federal figures show that the U.S. had goods trade deficits with only about half of all countries in 2017, and experts say that when including trade in services, that number is even smaller."	The most recent government figures show that the total U.S. trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was almost $677 billion — the highest since 2008 and an increase of 40.5% from 2016.	The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $616.8 billion in 2019. Imports were $3.1 trillion and exports were only $2.5 trillion. In 2019, the U.S. trade deficit in goods alone was $866 billion. 1 The United States exported $1.65 trillion in goods. 2 The biggest categories were commercial aircraft, automobiles, and food.

On Canada, Trump's statement is at best telling only part of the story."	A trade deficit occurs when a nation imports more than it exports. The U.S. trade deficit increased from $676.7 billion in 2020 to $859.1 billion in 2021. Long-term trade deficits hurt the economy, while a strong dollar and robust imports increase the deficit by raising export prices.

Texas leads nation in animal deaths due to exploding M-44 traps, or 'cyanide bombs'	The Environmental Protection Agency has refused to ban M-44s, commonly known as cyanide bombs, which cause agonizing deaths for thousands of animals every year.	More animals were taken in Texas than in all other states combined. Program-wide during FY 1977-81, M-44 effort averaged approximately 5,600 unit years annually and 1.2 target animals were recovered per M-44 year. M-44s accounted for 12.3 percent of all coyotes taken by the ADC program during FY 1976-86. The coyote take by M-44s doubled from FY ...	Roughly 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s. On Tuesday, after completing the first phase of a routine review, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would allow sodium cyanide's continued use in M-44s across the country on an interim basis.	The devices, officially called M-44s, have been used continuously for more than four decades by Wildlife Services, a program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. When a predator stumbles across one of these devices, a capsule containing sodium cyanide, a highly toxic pesticide, is ejected into its mouth.	Sodium cyanide (NaCN) ejectors for coyotes (Canis latrans), known as M-44s, are used in many parts of the United States for lethally removing coyotes to protect livestock or other resources. Quantifying selectivity of current devices in killing target and non-target species is important to users and provides a baseline for future development of more effective and selective techniques.

The town had just been rocked by news that the Hershey's chocolate plant, which opened in 1965, was closing and moving its operations to Mexico. Nearly 600 union jobs vanished. I went to see how people were reacting to the loss of not just a major employer, but a company that in many ways had defined the place.	The first products to cease production at the Oakdale plant will be Hershey's kisses with almonds and Hershey's syrup. Both product lines will be transferred to the Hershey's plant in Pennsylvania.

I heard about Hershey's moving their manufacturing to Mexico this week and it really upsets me. It will turn Hershey PA into a ghost town. I am so tired of these big companies putting hard working Americans out of work to save a buck. I think Mr. Hershey would roll over in his grave. I myself will stay clear of their products.	In recent years, Hershey has shifted production to Mexico and carried out a global restructuring that eliminated about 1,500 North American jobs, including about 800 in the midstate.

The 2010 Census is set to cost up to $14.5 billion."" By Robert Farley • June 11, 2010 Glenn Beck stated on January 29, 2010 in his Fox News program:"	The 2000 Census cost $4.5 billion. The 2010 Census is set to cost up to $14.5 billion. What are we spending the extra $10 billion on? And sure, of the jobs added last month, roughly 96 percent were census workers — temporary positions — but other than that, what's the big deal?	The bureau estimates that the cost of conducting the 2000 census will be $4.5 billion, $1.7 billion higher than its original estimate, due to the need to try to count everyone. A Detailed Look at How The 2000 Census Will Proceed	Imports of goods decreased $4.5 billion to $232.0 billion in April. Imports of goods on a Census basis decreased $4.6 billion. Consumer goods decreased $2.6 billion. Other textile apparel and household goods decreased $0.9 billion. Toys, games, and sporting goods decreased $0.7 billion. Household appliances decreased $0.7 billion.	Of that total, almost 500,000 did not graduate within six years - costing a combined $4.5 billion in lost income and lost federal and state income taxes. The AIR analysis found that the 493,000 students who started college in 2002 but did not earn a degree within six years lost a total of approximately $3.8 billion in income in 2010 alone.	Federal obligations for research and experimental development rose nearly 18% from FY 2019 to FY 2020, reaching $167.4 billion. This is the largest annual increase in current dollars since 1963. Obligations for research and experimental development from stimulus funding totaled $19.5 billion. These data are from the latest edition of the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development ...	The 2009-10 Budget Act assumes over $2.5 billion in cost reductions from various actions affecting state employee pay and benefit costs, including state employee furloughs and a one-day delay in the June 30, 2010 state payroll. Almost all of these savings are one-time in nature, including the Governor's furlough program, which ends June ...	There were budget provisions for the 2010 budget to provide universal coverage. In answering the Committee's question about redistribution of wealth, the delegation said it had been determined that $14.5 billion per year was what it would take in terms of income to lift all the poor of Colombia out of poverty.	For states, employment-by-industry data are obtained from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau 2013) data for 2011 and are mapped into 45 unique census industries and eight aggregated total and subtotals for a total of 53 sectors.25 We look at job displacement from 2001 to 2013, so from this point, we use [J nx01-13].

President Obama's refusal to grant permits for offshore drilling is one reason ..."	Power Africa was launched somewhere in 2013 with the goal of doubling access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Obama administration, the more than $7 billion investment over a period of five years would increase access to electricity by at least 20 million new households and businesses.	When Reagan took office interest rates were 19.5% and by his sixth year they were down to 7.5%. When Barack Obama took office interest rates were at 3.25% and have essentially stayed in that area since. That extraordinarily low rate is in large part due to the Fed's pumping of $4.5 trillion into the American economy since 2008, allowing the federal government to borrow like a drunken sailor.	After months of financial turmoil, an Energy Department-backed lithium ion battery company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company, Ener1, received a $118 million grant from DOE in 2010 as part of the president s stimulus package. The money, which went to Ener1 subsidiary EnerDel, aimed to promote renewable energy storage battery technology for electrical grid use.

The duo went on to get married, have kids - one of the things Aniston was accused of not willing to do - and later divorce as well. But, around the time when things between Jolie and Pitt were fresh, multiple stories haunted Aniston.	The consensus is that Brad Pitt couldn't resist Angelina Jolie's feminine wiles on the set of their 2005 film Mr. and Mrs. Smith, so he quickly abandoned Aniston for the younger, more sensual Jolie. Underpinning this theory is the widespread belief that Angelina offered something Jennifer didn't: the opportunity to have children.	Angelina Jolie is, allegedly, luring Brad Pitt to hurt Jennifer Aniston. According to Woman's Day , Angelina Jolie has been spending a lot of time with Pitt during the pandemic because she wants to get her revenge on Aniston.

The Truth: Reports that Michigan ""just"" made sodomy a felony are false. But there is a kernel truth hidden in the rumor. The Michigan State Senate updated a section of penal code on animal cruelty in January."	The Michigan Senate has passed a bill that effectively reaffirms the state's unconstitutional law making sodomy a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.Â. Michigan is one of more than a dozen states that still have sodomy bans on the books, despite the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003Â ruling in Lawrence v.

The Michigan state senate passed bill SB 219 on February 8, which serves harsher punishment for animal abusers, but somehow also made sodomy illegal and punishable by over a decade in prison.	As residents of Flint, Michigan continue to suffer from their city's lead-tainted water, the Michigan Senate was focused on an entirely different issue: sodomy. The state Senate voted to pass SB 0219 that would make animal abuse illegal in the state. It added a section that outlaws sodomy and makes it a felony punishable by 15 years in prison.	Two days ago, we here at Bipartisan Report reported on a new bill in Michigan that, no joke, reaffirmed statewide anti-sodomy laws that have been deemed unconstitutional since 2003.Now the author of the bill has come forth, claiming that his intention was not, in any way, to make any consensual sex acts among humans into a criminal offense.	During their session last week, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that effectively bans all forms of sodomy, anal, oral, gay and non-gay — making the acts punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The passage of this Bill is in spite of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 ruling in Lawrence v.

A recent state-by-state report sheds new light on the property taxes paid by homeowners across the nation. Unsurprisingly, Texas ranks among the highest. According to WalletHub, Texas homeowners pay the sixth-highest property tax bills on a $194,000 home, the median home value nationwide in 2017. But home values between states vary dramatically.

As such, Texas ranks sixth as a state with the highest average property tax rates, which currently averages at 1.60%. This means that the Texas property taxes remain among the highest property taxes in the nation, while the overall tax burden remains one of the lowest.	Apr 6, 2017According to a WalletHub study, Texas now has the sixth highest effective property tax rate in the nation. The property tax burden falls heavily on seniors and others with fixed incomes.	In 2017, California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Illinois paid the highest amount in federal taxes by state. California paid $234.49 billion, followed by New York with $140.51 billion, and Texas with $133.41 billion. Florida and Illinois contributed $116.97 billion and $67.180 billion.	Methodology. In order to determine the states with the highest and lowest property taxes, WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia by using U.S. Census Bureau data to determine real-estate property tax rates and applying assumptions based on national auto-sales data to determine vehicle property tax rates.	Between 2005 and 2014, property tax collections grew about 2.5 times faster than median household income. Texas now has the sixth highest effective property tax rate in the nation.	Arizona and Texas, both of which rely heavily on consumption taxes, tie for sixth highest taxes on the poor in the nation, at 13.0 percent.

But Obamacare's tax increases offset its costs to the tune of $104 billion between 2010 and 2019. Congress and Obama also negotiated the sequestration budget cuts.

If a large amount is consumed, dogs can become hyperactive and have a rapid heart rate, seizures, and diarrhea. While unlikely, the consumption of cocoa mulch can be fatal to dogs.

Cocoa mulch can be toxic to dogs Consumer Reports News: June 30, 2006 09:04 AM You usually can ignore most e-mails you receive warning you of the dire consequences of doing, X, Y, or Z.	Cocoa mulch is a by-product of cocoa production. The dark brown mulch is aesthetically and aromatically pleasing, giving the garden a rich, chocolatey scent.

Toxicity can occur at a dose of 100-250 mg, meaning a 60 lb. dog only needs to eat less than 3 ounces of cocoa mulch to become poisoned.

Cocoa bean mulch, for example, has an attractive smell that makes the ingestion of the mulch an interesting prospect to many dogs.

SOURCE: Harrison Schmitt & Rodney Nichols, The Wall Street Journal. Published: 02 Nov 2016.	Elevated carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere may increase water-use efficiency in crops and considerably mitigate yield losses due to climate change.	Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty.	Based on preliminary analysis, the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2020 was 412.5 parts per million (ppm for short), setting a new record high amount despite the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the jump of 2.6 ppm over 2019 levels was the fifth-highest annual increase in NOAA's 63-year record.	The addition of approximately 135 ppm of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by humans—through the burning of fossil fuels and various other actions—has helped dramatically reduce hunger. As proof, despite the addition of 3.2 billion people to the planet since 1968, poverty and hunger have fallen at a faster rate than at any time in human history.	Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels might help some crops grow more rapidly, but it can also speed up the growth of weeds and pests that threaten crops. true Which RCP scenario has the highest global population in 2100?	Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased ~38% since pre-industrial times (1800: ~ 280 ppm ; 2010: ~ 380 ppm) About 40% of CO2 emissions have remained in the atmosphere, the rest has been absorbed by carbon sinks (mainly oceans) This increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration correlates with an increase in average global temperature

What states have line item veto? Forty-three states—all except Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Vermont—give their governors some form of line-item veto power. The Mayor of Washington, D.C. also has this power.	Line item veto authority refers to the power of a governor to veto individual components (or lines) of a bill passed by the state legislature.According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, 44 states allow their governors to veto individual line items of legislative budgets.The table below summarizes line-item veto provisions by state.

""Forty-four other states have a line-item veto and the vast majority of Rhode Islanders support it."""	In addition, 15 states have item veto authority of selected words while 4 have the ability to change the meaning of words. Some of these powers do, however, have restrictions. For example, in Hawaii the governor may veto judicial and legislative appropriations bills only in their entirety. Six states do not have any form of line item veto.	"In forty-three states, governors have line item veto power.[7] Most states have a ""plural executive"" in which two or more members of the executive branch are elected directly by the people. Such additional elected officials serve as members of the executive branch, but are not beholden to the governor and the governor cannot dismiss them."	Forty of the forty-three line-item veto states are represented in the data, including ten of the eleven item reduction veto states.

The statement is accurate ...	A 0.05 standard for drunken driving means having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. By Tom Kertscher • May 17, 2013 Load more Inside PolitiFact	A 0.05 illegal BAC is not typically reached with a couple of beers after work or with a glass of wine or two with dinner. It takes at least four drinks for an average 170-pound male to exceed 0.05 BAC in 2 hours on an empty stomach (three drinks for a 137-pound female).	If Utah passes the lower limit BAC law, let's hope that it doesn't become a trendsetter for the rest of the states. For many people, a 0.05 percent blood alcohol content limit will mean that they'll be subject to a DUI after only a glass of wine with dinner and who are clearly not under the influence nor a danger to the streets.	If Utah passes the lower limit BAC law, let's hope that it doesn't become a trendsetter for the rest of the states. For many people, a 0.05 percent blood alcohol content limit will mean that they'll be subject to a DUI after only a glass of wine with dinner and who are clearly not under the influence nor a danger to the streets.	A BAC of 0.02 can be reached after the consumption of only one standard drink (a middy of beer, a nip of spirits or a small glass of wine). Drivers subject to a 0.02 limit should not drink any alcohol before driving. Under 0.05 applies to: ALL other licences (including overseas and interstate licence holders) not subject to a 0.02 or zero limit	a 180-pound man could consume four beers or glasses of wine in 90 minutes without reaching the current limit. At a limit of 0.05 percent, he could legally consume only three.	In the chart, one drink equals 1.5 ounces of hard liquor, 12 ounces of beer, or five ounces of wine. For example, one ten-ounce glass of wine would count as two drinks. Also, time is an important consideration in using the chart. The human body metabolizes alcohol over time. Generally, this metabolization reduces a person's BAC by about .015% ...	Zero-tolerance laws make it a criminal DUI offense for drivers under the age of 21 to drive with even a small amount of alcohol in their system, ranging from 0.00 to 0.02 percent BAC depending on the state. In light of such laws, even an innocent glass of wine with dinner could subject a young driver with a DUI charge.	Can You Get A DUI After Only Two Glasses of Wine? A typical 5 ounce glass of wine is about 12% alcohol. An average man weighing 180lbs who has two 5 ounce glasses of wine would expect to reach a peak BAC of only 0.05%.

tron-00391	Researchers found that ticks favor opossums twice as much as the other animals, and opossums are the most effective at killing ticks. Opossums kill almost every tick that occupies them; a single opossum kills over 5500 ticks per week. Effective at eating disease-causing ticks, opossums are resistant to many diseases themselves.	Due to the ever-changing climatic conditions, tick population along with the diseases they carry are spreading rapidly. These diseases (which include Lyme Disease ) are very difficult to treat. Since opossums consume so many ticks, allowing them into your garden could curtail the spread of these devastating illnesses that tick carry.	Yet, note that while data indicates that opossums eat thousands of deer ticks per season and thus can prevent the spreading of Lyme Disease to humans, their effect on the Lyme Disease infection rates is indeterminate. Sources: www.newstimes.com. www.boston25news.com. www.ajc.com.	"Opossums Kill Ticks, Help Stop the Spread of Lyme Disease-Mostly Truth!Summary of eRumor: Opossums stop the spread of Lyme disease because they kill up to 4,000 ticks a week.

An ""Awesome Possum"" meme, as it has become known, was posted at the image-sharing ..."	A popular meme asserted opossums kill most deer ticks they encounter and thus inhibit the spread of Lyme disease to humans. Kim LaCapria Published 22 March 2016	"If for no other reason than pest control, opossums are great to have around!"" The following video provides an explanation of their habits and why having them in the backyard is beneficial: Nowadays, the populations of ticks are on the rise, leading to the increased spread of tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, and fourteen others."	Interestingly, ticks that manage to feed on opossums successfully are at a lower risk of picking up the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Why this discovery is important Due to the ever-changing climatic conditions, tick population along with the diseases they carry are spreading rapidly.	Lyme disease & opossums. January 3, 2017. Can you guess what animal found throughout the United States is turning out to be an unsung hero helping to prevent the spread of Lyme Disease? A hint it's a marsupial, just like a kangaroo. Keesing: Well, opossums are unusual in that they turn out to eat ticks, to kill ticks at a really, really high rate.	Opossums Are Resistant to Rabies and Snakebites — and Have Clever Forms of Self-Defense. In addition to helping curb the spread of Lyme disease, opossums are also resistant to rabies. This may come as a surprise to many, because opossums also drool excessively as a form of self-defense — a phenomenon many assume occurs because the animal is ...

Summary of eRumor: Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are radioactive and add more toxicity to the environment than regular light bulbs because they contain mercury. The Truth: This one is true, false and misleading all at once.	CFLs are a type of fluorescent lamp. Many models of CFLs are available that are designed to replace traditional incandescent bulbs. The compact size of these CFLs allows them to fit into many ...	Mercury-containing light bulbs include: fluorescent bulbs, including compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs); high intensity discharge (HID) bulbs, which include mercury vapor bulbs, metal halide and high-pressure sodium bulbs, and are used for streetlights, floodlights, parking lots, and industrial lighting; and.	Sounds good—until you realize that CFL bulbs contain mercury, and mercury poses a significant cancer risk. A new study shows that CFL bulbs also emit high levels of ultraviolet radiation—specifically, UVC and UVA rays. In fact, the UV rays are so strong that they can actually burn skin and skin cells.	"According to the Alliance for Natural Health, CFL bulbs are made with mercury, emit radiation and are a cancer risk to families. ""The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandates the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs and favors energy-efficient compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs."	Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) and Mercury. Mercury is an essential element in the operation of fluorescent lighting; it allows the bulbs to be an efficient light source. Because CFLs contain trace amounts of mercury, it is important to educate yourself on proper use, recycling and disposal of these products.	A: These energy-efficient bulbs are safe when used as directed. All types of fluorescent bulbs contain mercury vapor, which emits ultraviolet (UV) rays when exposed to an electric current.But lab experiments have shown that CFLs do emit some UV, sometimes enough to damage skin cells placed directly under them.	About compact fluorescent lamps. Fluorescent lights have been around for a long time, and CFLs are the latest variation on the traditional tube fluorescent light. CFLs fit into a standard light bulb socket. Like the old-style fluorescent lights, they use a different method to produce light, which makes them energy-efficient. They are low ...	UV Radiation: Health Canada released a study in 2009 which looked at both the UV and EMF risks posed by CFLs. The study found that the UV risks from these bulbs are very low for most people, but they do recommend that you sit more than 30cm away from a bulb as a precaution. So don't sit too close! Those with auto-immune disorders may be more ...
