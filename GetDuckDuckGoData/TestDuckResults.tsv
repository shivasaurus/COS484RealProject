pomt-03627	In April 2020, the unemployment rate reached 14.8%—the highest rate observed since data collection began in 1948. In July 2021, unemployment remained higher (5.4%) than it had been in	Unemployment Rates for States, Seasonally Adjusted. Note: Rates shown are a percentage of the labor force. Data refer to place of residence. Estimates for the current month are subject to revision the following month.	6 days agoThe U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent. Wages showed sharp gains, but that has been blunted by inflation.	In 2021, 20 states had rates lower than those of the U.S. for all six measures of labor underutilization, while 4 states had rates higher than those of the U.S. for all six measures. (See table A .) The U-4 rate includes discouraged workers; thus, the difference between U-3 and U-4 reflects the degree of would-be job-seeker discouragement.	Illinois also ranked among the highest when compared to other states, but fared better than New York whose jobless rate was 6.9% and Nevada and California, which tied for the highest unemployment ...

The 2020 rate was the highest since 1997, though still well below the peak 10.2 rate recorded in 1980. The rate of aggravated assaults also rose under Trump — by 12.6%.	These figures help explain the high unemployment rates observed in Spain over the past three decades— averaging 17.3 percent compared to 7.6 percent for EU-8 countries and 5.2 percent for the U.S. These effects also demonstrate that wages are highly inflexible, and the firing costs associated with regular work contracts are excessive.	The unemployment rate can wobble for all sorts of reasons. It rose toward 10% during the Great Recession as employers shed staff. The unemployment rate is so low at the moment not only because hiring has been strong, but also because some people who might otherwise be counted as jobless are still not looking for work.	The national unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 24 hit 19.6 percent in April—the highest ever. For the younger subset of 16-to-19-year-olds, the rate was 25.4 percent; for the past year, unemployment rates for this group have been higher than ever before. Some parts of the teenage population are faring especially poorly.
